## General Information

- Real world scenario of manipulating the DOM with a combination of skills - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project appends data and shows the user how JavaScript improves usability. The user learns how to refactor and test (debug) code as they figure out the codes function. 
- The landing page consist of multiple sections, that contains content that can be added or removed dynamically. A smooth scroll affect with every click on a navigation item improves the users expierence as each active section is viewed. 
- A great use of logic is used. There is no single correct answer when building this project. 

- Real world scenario of manipulating the DOM with a combination of skills - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
- Contains Navagation, Section, Back to Top Button, Scroll and Animation
- Created with Blood, Sweat and Tears. (Weeks of it to be exact!)


## Instructions

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
