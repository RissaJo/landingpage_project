To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

## Description

- Real world scenario of manipulating the DOM with a combination of skills - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project appends data and shows the user how JavaScript improves usability. The user learns how to refactor and test (debug) code as they figure out the codes function. 
- The landing page consist of multiple sections, that contains content that can be added or removed dynamically. A smooth scroll affect with every click on a navigation item improves the users expierence as each active section is viewed. 
- A great use of logic is used. There is no single correct answer when building this project. 


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Repositiory may be cloned to desktop_
* _Locate the top level of the directory_
* _Opeb test.html in browser_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
